cexio-reinvest
==============

A minor personal project to calculate and visualize some thoughts about a good mining/re-invest strategy at cex.io.  Mostly it's just a simple HTML/JavaScript/Highchart page calculating possible earnings, if all bitcoin mining return will be re-invested at cex.io.

## How to use

You can use this tool at [my site](http://www.ltcinstawallet.com/cexio-reinvest).

### Selfhosted

On your web server do:

```
git clone git@github.com:johndoe75/cexio-reinvest.git
```

and point your browser to `http://{yourdomain}/cexio-reinvest/index.html`.

## TODO

* Add possibility to specify after which time a specific amount of GH/s will be added beside the cex.io re-investment.  E.g. double GH/s every 3 months or add 100 GH/s every 6 months or so.

* Get the current difficulty e.g. from [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/de/q/getdifficulty).

* Get the current price per GH/s from cex.io API.

* Add a table with results -- incl. earnings in USD and EUR.  Get the exchange rate from MtGox.

* Take in account, that the hashpower will greatly increase beginning next year (when new Avalon or Butterfly Labs miners will arrive on market).
